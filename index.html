  <p>Rememory Me, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

  <h3 id="game">Why Play?</h3>
  <p>Rememory Me is a game almost anyone can play, from a yound toddler to an adult! This game is fun because you can play with family and friends or play by yourself to help pass the time. This game helps people improve their short term memory by making the players remember where each card is throughout the game. Since the arrangement of the cards change each game, you'll barely find yourself looking in the same spots for matches.
